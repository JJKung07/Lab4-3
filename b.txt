Title: "Unspoken Truth"

Scene: A dimly lit interrogation room in a police precinct.

Detective Sarah Jensen sits across from Alex Thompson, a suspect in a high-profile case involving corporate espionage.

Jensen: (leaning forward) Mr. Thompson, we have evidence linking you to the data breach at TrionCorp. Care to explain how your fingerprints ended up on the server?

Thompson: (calmly) I already told you, I have nothing to do with it. You're making a mistake.

Jensen: (skeptical) Mistakes don't leave behind fingerprints, Alex. We found your prints all over that server room.

Thompson: (leaning in, earnestly) Look, Detective, I was there, but not for the reasons you think. I was trying to stop it.

Jensen: (raising an eyebrow) Stop it? And how do you explain the encrypted files downloaded to your personal drive?

Thompson: (hesitating) I can't disclose everything yet, not until I know I can trust you. There's something bigger at play here.

Jensen: (leaning back, studying him) Trust works both ways, Alex. Right now, I'm not seeing a reason to believe you.

Thompson: (frustrated) Because you don't have the whole picture! There are powerful people involved, people who'll do anything to cover their tracks.

Jensen: (softening slightly) Then help me see that picture. Give me something to work with.

Thompson: (pausing, conflicted) I need time. There are lives at stake, including mine.

Jensen: (considering) I can't promise immunity, but I can promise protection if you cooperate.

Thompson: (nodding) That might have to do... for now.

They exchange a tense look, a silent understanding passing between them. The room remains filled with unspoken tension, both knowing they've just scratched the surface of a deeper conspiracy.
